# Usage

Two to four players can play the game and only one button is required to play. The game is based around a monster,
the Grizzly Ghoul, who has stolen all the magical beans in the land and has taken them to his cave. While he naps, other creatures of the land decide to go and recover the beans in the cave. At the start of a playerâ€™s turn they can decide if they want to take their turn by saying go, or skip their turn by saying pass. If the player chooses to go then they can take a step in the cave by pressing the button. Each button press represents a step in the cave and you might find a bean with each step. Players are allowed up to 3 steps and given 10 seconds to make their move each turn.  But the monster has placed traps in the cave, and the third trap will wake the monster. The goal of the game is to recover as many beans as you can before the monster wakes up. The player with the most beans when the monster wakes up wins! 
 
Since the locations of these traps are randomly placed and players do not know if their step will uncover a trap, this gives the players a sense of suspense. In addition, collecting the magical beans and giving the user the option to take their turn or pass, adds a strategy element to the game.
